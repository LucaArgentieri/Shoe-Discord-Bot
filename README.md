# Shoe Discord Bot
⚠️ Work in progress, but we are fixing :)
## Idea
We had in mind to build a bot to stay updated on the prices and upcoming releases of the sneakers.
The biggest problem was finding the right API, but we managed to find a guy who did a huge job, put together: StockX FlightClub, Goat and Stadium Goods API, cool right?


With this mega api we started studying discord.js and the project started.

## API
[Sneaks-API](https://github.com/druv5319/Sneaks-API)

A StockX API, FlightClub API, Goat API, and Stadium Goods API all in one.

Sneaks API is a sneaker API built using Node.JS, Express, and Got. The Sneaks API allows users to get essential sneaker content such as images, product links and even prices from resell sites while also collecting data and storing it within a database.
